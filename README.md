# FlagService
Simple and small library(uncompiled, WIP) for dealing with terminal parameters passed to an application

# TODO
* Parameters controll - secure the scope of pointers in `services_execute` method
* ... (I don't know right now, but for sure I'll figure out something)
* Compile and pack it into library
